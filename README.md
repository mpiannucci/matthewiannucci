My personal site, built with [astro](https://astro.build/).

The site is static generated at build time. New blog entries can be added and deployed by committing new entries to `src/content/blog`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

This app is currently deployed to Cloudflare Pages. It is configured to deploy automatically when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
