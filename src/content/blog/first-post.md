Hi! I used to blog many years ago on my old personal site, but have decided to start fresh with a new blog. I plan to use this as a space where I can write up my thoughts or deep dive on probably niche topics that I am interested in at a given time. Some of the topics I plan to write about include data engineering in weather and oceanographic spaces and surfing. I hope you enjoy the content I plan to write and share here.

Much more to come soon!
